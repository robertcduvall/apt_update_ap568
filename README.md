# CompSci 390 APT Update
## Aaron Price

This project updates Duke CompsSci's APT submission system to improve the experience for students by adding an AI chatbot with context on their code, test cases, and problem.


### Update Ideas and Thoughts

Added chatbot to keep students in Zone of Proximal Development and give them a thought partner when OH are not happening. This should reduce cheating / reliance on LLMs that give too much information.


### Attributions

 * Resources used for learning: ChatGPT, ChakraUI Docs, React-Chatbot-Kit Docs.
 
 * Resources used directly: React-Chatbot-Kit library, ChakraUI


### How to Run the Program (if necessary)

npm install
npm run dev

Website starts at localhost:3000


### Notes

Website currently only allows bagels.py model submission and chatbot only responds to questions regarding test case 3 and line 5 of code.


### Student Level
101 level


### Tracking
Would track the types of questions students ask to provide better feedback to professors on what to cover more deeply in class.

### Impressions
1. "This is really cool! Initially I was nervous the chatbot would detract from learning but I like how it guides without giving answers."
2. "I miss the all green from the original when you got it right."
3. "I like it. That's all."
